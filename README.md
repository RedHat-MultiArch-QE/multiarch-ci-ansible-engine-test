# Multi-Arch CI Test Template
This project serves as a template for multi-arch tests for RedHat's downstream CI. Currently, this template test can be run only on Jenkins enviroments deployed with the tools provided by the [Multi-Arch CI Pipeline](https://github.com/RedHat-MultiArch-QE/multiarch-ci-pipeline). The only known environment that supports this exists internal to RedHat; however, efforts are being made to support further multi-arch testing upstream as part of the great CentOS CI initiative (see https://github.com/CentOS-PaaS-SIG/multiarch-openshift-ci for an example of this effort specifically for OpenShift). You can see our latest template release notes [here](https://github.com/RedHat-MultiArch-QE/multiarch-ci-test-template/releases).

## Getting Started
The only current Jenkins [instance](https://multiarch-qe-aos-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com) equipped with the tools and configuration capable of running this test template is internal to RedHat. This guide assumes that you have admin access to this enviroment, or have been able to set up an equivalent enviroment using Multi-Arch CI Pipeline](https://github.com/RedHat-MultiArch-QE/multiarch-ci-pipeline). Further documentation on setting up your own enviroment can be found [here](https://github.com/RedHat-MultiArch-QE/multiarch-ci-pipeline).
